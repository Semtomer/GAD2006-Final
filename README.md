# GAD2006-Final
This repository is the final project of the GAD2006 Advanced Game Development course I took in the Digital Game Design department at Bahcesehir University. (3rd grade 1st semester)

Note: When I submitted this project for the final assignment, the AI ​​enemies in the project were not working properly. I tried so hard to fix it at that time, but I couldn't find the reason. There were also several different bugs in the game. Also, I had a problem unzipping the project files that I just zip uped to upload the project to Git Hub. I understood and solved the problem, but I did not test whether it causes new bugs. I hope there are no other new bugs.

Note: Since no more than 2 GB files are uploaded to Github at one time, I separated the project files into 3 different zips. So if you unzip 3 zip's under one folder named "COA" you can open Unreal project.

Note: If you unzip and open the Unreal project, you need to open "Map_MainMenu.umap" to start the game from the main menu.

The details of the given project are as follows:

Final Project          
There are 3 different characters in the game: Warrior, Iceball, and Fireball.    
There are 5 different stats in the game: Strength, Agility, Endurance, Intelligence, and Luck.    
And there are 12 different skills in the game that these 5 different stats affect: Health, Mana, Stamina, Shield Health (for Warrior), Base Attack Damage, Strong Attack Damage, Walking Speed, Running Speed, Health Regeneration Speed, Stamina Regeneration Speed, Mana Regeneration Speed, and Critical Attack Chance.     

In the beginning, the player is given the right to distribute 10 stat points as he/she wishes, and the player can distribute these 10 stat points by choosing the character he/she wants.        

When the game starts, the player comes to his/her village using the character he/she chooses and realizes that he/she has two options when he/she sees that his/her village is occupied by zombies and that his/her neighbors are zombies. Either the player will save his/her village from this invasion by killing all the zombies and going home or the player will run away to his/her house in a cowardly way. Either way, the player wins the game. If he/she dies, he/she loses the game.

If the player chooses the Warrior character, the character swings his sword on the base attack and spins and swings his sword on the strong attack. In addition, as a special attack, the character creates a shield wall and the damage taken from the enemies does not come directly to himself with this shield.

If the player chooses the Fireball character, the character throws a fireball in the base attack and creates and throws a strong fireball in the strong attack. In addition, as a special attack, the character can hook one of the hook poles around him if he is not near the enemy and is looking towards one of the hook poles and can go to the hook pole with the hook power.

If the player chooses the Iceball character, the character throws an iceball in the base attack and creates and throws a strong iceball in the strong attack. In addition, as a special attack, the character can hook one of the hook poles around him if he is not near the enemy and is looking towards one of the hook poles and can go to the hook pole with the hook power.

Also, all three characters can jump, run, and dash in the game.

Note: I do not write the keys because there is a how-to-play part in the game.
